Unfinished Creation: Racer UI Card 

Practicing a CSS animation trick with the navbar top left of the profile and am trying a different method for positioning the Card compared to my Minimalistic Spy Card Project

Big issue I ran into is a cross browser compatibility issue with CSS.
Specifically, the Gradient CSS Instruction works just fine in Safari and Chrome, but NOT Firefox.

I have spent hours on this thing, with my last idea being to create a class called "BodyGradient" and add it directly to the Body html tags... which didn't work.
I really want to figure out why this CSS gradient issue is even an issue before I continue.
